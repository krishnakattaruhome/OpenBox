Hashing/Hashing Algorithms
  Mathematical formulas that transform messages into deterministic, fixed-length representational strings
  -> To hash a 'message/data/packet' to a 'Digest' using 'hashing algorithm'.
    md5, sha1, SHA256, SHA3-xxx

Keys/Secret Keys
  Sequence of 1's and 0's
  Sized in number of "bits"

Symmetric Cryptography
    Mathematical operations performed with one secret key and verified with same key.
  Encryption
    Plain Text -> Key -> Cipher text -> Key -> Plain Text
    AES - 128/192/256, ChaCha20
  MAC/HMAC
    Using the secret key to hash a message and transmit the message + digest
    HMAC,Poly1305
  Pseudo Random Function
